# PingPong2Player

# Description:
This is a 2 Player PingPong game that involves the ball starting in the middle and will head in either the left or right direction. The goal of the two players is to hit the ball past the other's paddle.

# Controls:
Since this is a 2 Player Game, the left paddle uses the "W' and "S" Keys on keyboard, and the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys for the right paddle. Both players can play simultaneously and can control their paddles without playing on a turn-by-turn basis or per round. The reset button will reset the score displayed under the gameboard, however, the ball will instantly be in play once the reset button is clicked.

# Future Directions:
I plan to implement more styling to the gameboard (ex. Net in the middle, A ball that looks more like a Tennis Ball, maybe even an audience as the border of the gameboard). I also would like to implement sounds when one player scores and when the reset button is clicked (ex. Crowd Cheering when scored, Whistle when the reset button is clicked).
